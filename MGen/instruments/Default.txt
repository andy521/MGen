# CHN is MIDI channel to send this instrument to (for adapted MIDI file export and sending to MIDI port)
# TRK is MIDI track to send this instrument to (for adapted MIDI file export)
# PRT shows if this instrument is connected to MIDI port and can receive MIDI messages in real time
# If PRT is "-", this instrument can be used only for offline processing through adapted MIDI file export

# Last instrument in layout must be default instrument, which will get all unmapped instruments

# Randomization
rnd_tempo = 6 # Randomize tempo not greater than this percent
rnd_tempo_step = 1 # Maximum difference in tempo (percent) between adjacent steps while randomizing
