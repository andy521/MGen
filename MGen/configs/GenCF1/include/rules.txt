# Rules: 0 - show only without violation, 1 - show with or without violation, 2 - show only violations
# ! means that this rule can produce results without other rules with c_len = 9, interval 4-7
# Flag order in list below goes from green - less severe (top) to red - more severe (bottom)
# Groups:
# S - strict rules that can usually be violated
# U - universal for all melodies
# C - rules specifially for cantus firmus
# L - rules specifially for lower cantus firmus
# H - rules specifially for higher cantus firmus
# V - rules appropriate for vocal melody
