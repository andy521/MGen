# This file contains all supported music generator algorithms
# If you create new algorithm, you have to add it to this file
# MFI is MIDI File Import support. If it is 1 than your algorithm must support Midi_file parameter in config
# XFI is MusicXML File Import support. If it is 1 than your algorithm must support MusicXML_file parameter in config
